Torafugu's Catppuccin Rice, showcased in the ricing channel of the Arch Linux Community Discord.

## Requirements

* `waybar-cava` for the audio visualizer on the bar (no need to install waybar, as it is installed with the package).
* `starship` for the prompt.
* `fish` as the shell, as starship was configured for fish.
* `hyprland` as the window manager
* `swaync` as the notification center and daemon
* `kitty` for that good looking terminal.
* `cava` for `waybar-cava`
* `wttrbar` for weather.
* `waypaper` for wallpaper
* `catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha` from the AUR
* `rofi` for app launcher.

If there's more, I'm sure you'll figure it out :P

Make sure to move `catppuccin.rasi` to `/usr/share/rofi/themes/` and then set the theme with `rofi-theme-selector`
